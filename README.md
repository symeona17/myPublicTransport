# myPublicTransport
As a part of our UI/UX course in our Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering studies, Maira &amp; I had the assignment to design a public transport application.

For the creation of the logo, materials from <a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/travel-logo-template_47620726.htm#query=tour%20bus%20logo&position=1&from_view=search&track=ais&uuid=45664c9f-4890-44bf-9d64-b88ea967d0b3">Freepik</a> were used.
