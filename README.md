# myPublicTransport
As a part of our UI/UX course in our Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering studies, Maira &amp; I had the assignment to design a public transport application.

While designing the application, we researched the needs of a public transport application, looked into our target audience using personas and the PACT framework, and brainstormed different use scenarios. For a reference application, we used the website of <a href="https://www.ktelmessinias.gr/en/homepage-en/">Ktel Messinias</a>, on which we performed a thorough analysis.

Almost all materials in this project are in Greek language.

To view the design, you will need to use <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma<a/>.

For the creation of the logo, materials from <a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/travel-logo-template_47620726.htm#query=tour%20bus%20logo&position=1&from_view=search&track=ais&uuid=45664c9f-4890-44bf-9d64-b88ea967d0b3">Freepik</a> were used.
